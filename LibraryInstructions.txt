RadioHead Library Installation:

If you are reading this then you have already extracted the files somewhere, however, you need to move the extracted 
Folder  that is named "RadioHead" into the arduino Library folder. 

goto:
Local Disk (where ever arduino IDE is installed) ----> Program Files (x86) ----> Arduino ----> Library (move here)

If you have an arduino that is a third party device (knock off version of arduino e.g. elegoo or sparkfun) then you
might have external drivers you need to install. Otherwise, the SPI.h and LoRa.h  should be ready to go... Have Fun!
